The number of lines of text that appear in the output (terminal screen) after executing the program is different. Why?
R: Devido à função pfork() que cria um processo child exatamente igual ao processo parent

In this program there are 2 processes involved. Which process is responsible for each line
of text that appears in the output? Use the values of PID and PPID to get to the answer.
R: PID = 12787, PPID = 11975 -> process parent
   PID = 12787, PPID = 11975 -> process parent
   PID = 12788, PPID = 12787 -> process child

Message “Was I printed by the parent or by the child process? How can I know it?”
appears twice. Can you say which process print each one of them?
R: Não podemos saber

Edit program fork1.cpp, change the second argument of the bwRandomDelay function to
2000, save the changes, recompile and try to answer again the previous questions. Run it
more than once.
